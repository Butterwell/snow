# The Making of "A Short History of Snowfall"
## (Also, the working specification)

---

# Concept
## Show the amount of snowfall on a map for each year.
This treatment inspired by the record-breaking snowfall in Boston for the winter of 2014-2015.
* A REST API to query world-wide weather station measurements is available at: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/...
* Instructions on how to get a developer token to access the data are here: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2

---

# The Perfect Dataset
What dataset would minimize data wrangling and thus make this project?
* Evenly spaced observations
* Daily observations
* Covering the earth
* For all the earth for all of recorded history
* All in a tidy dataset See:
https://github.com/Butterwell/datasharing

Let's start with where measurements are made: weather stations. In particular...

---

# Snow Weather Stations

The API delivers a maximum of 1000 records a call.

To get the first 1000 weather stations by date with curl:
```bash
token=This_is_not_a_valid_token
curl --header "Token: $token" --get \
-d datatypeid=SNOW -d limit=1000 -d sortfield=mindate \
www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/stations > earliest_1000_snow_stations.json
```
This is the same as, given the nodejs file get.js:

```JavaScript
var request = require('request');

var options = {
    headers: { 'Token': 'This is not a valid token' },
    uri: 'https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/stations'+
         '?datatypeid=SNOW&limit=1000&sortfield=mindate'
};

request(options, function (error, resp, body) {
    console.log(body)
});
```
```bash
node get.js > earliest_1000_snow_stations.json
```

At this point we don't know where any of these stations are. They might all be in the Swiss Alps.

### An introduction to dynamic D3 could go here (weather stations plotted by date founded)

# Irregularities
* Stations are not in a grid
* Stations do not have data every day
* Stations are added and removed over time

---

# Station Irregularities Can be Solved by Binning
## Hex Binning

# Most Stations are in Canada and USA .subtitle[(before 1890)]
But this could be misleading... there might only be three stations measuring. That is, we don't know the distribution of measurements for any of these stations, or between those stations. Let's grab some snowfall data. First, where is it?

---

# Daily Snow Measurements Dataset
We were able to easily find the station information since it is at the top level of the API. The data is found in a particular dataset, but which one? Here's how to search the "datasets" dataset to find all the datasets than have the datatypeid "SNOW", the field we want:
```JavaScript
var token="This is not a vaild token"
d3.json("https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/datasets?datatypeid=SNOW")
  .header("token", token)
  .get(function(error, data) {
     console.log(data.results)
  });
```
Shows us there is one dataset, GHCND, that has the data.

---

# Minimum Visualization Data .subtitle[Getting Some Data]

Poking around at the data with curl, we find out that the maximum time span allowed for GHCND is one year. Since we're interested in snow, we break the year at July 1st. We also want a year with under 1000 entries, the maximum allowed in one call.
```bash
curl --header "token: $token" --get -d datasetid=GHCND \
-d startdate=1859-07-01 -d enddate=1860-07-01 -d datatypeid=SNOW -d limit=1000 \
www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/data > winter_snow_1859_1860.json
```
---

# Minimum Visualization Data .subtitle[Data Distribution]

There are 499 entries for this winter. Let's plot the count of non-zero entries.

.snow_measures_1859_1860[]

Several entries at the 230mm mark, about 9". How about Boston values for January 1st and 2nd, 2014?

.snow_measures_2014_01_01[]

There are 226 entries and a similar distribution.

# How Much Data

---

# Offline Considerations
## Manifest File

---

# Drawing Mountains of Snow

---

# Melting
* Not all stations measure current depth.
* Since we were not showing the melting all along, is melting lieing?
* First pass: reset to 0 depth on July 1st.

---

# Wait... How Long is This Going to Take?
* We have data from 186x to 2015.
If we display a day's worth of information in one frame, and run the visualization at twenty-four frames a second, a year takes about a second and a half to display. ((2015-1860)*365/24)/60 = 39 minutes.

# Providing more information
* Minimum yearly, maximum yearly on hover

# A Need for Speed
* What is the fastest we can deliver it the first time
* What is the fastest we can deliver it subsequent times
* Station Encoding
* Snowfall Encoding
* Progressive enhancement
* Additional benifit, don't expose token

# NOAA Available Data
It took some exploration of the datatypeids to find "SNOW". Here's a list.
